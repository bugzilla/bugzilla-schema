#
# 1. INTRODUCTION
#
# This module contains data structures holding remarks concerning
# the Bugzilla schema.  These remarks are automatically included in the
# Bugzilla schema doc by the code in  make_schema_doc.py.
#
# The intended readership is project developers.
#
# This document is not confidential.

import string
import re

# All the strings here are going to be passed to Python's % formatting
# operator, with a dictionary on the right-hand-side containing various
# strings which can therefore be automatically inserted.
#
# %(column-foo-bar)s turns into a link "foo.bar" to column bar of table foo.
#
# %(table-foo)s turns into a link "foo" to table foo.
#
# %(the-table-foo)s turns into "the foo table" where "foo" is a link
#  to table foo.
#
# and some other special-case strings such as VERSION_STRING,
# VERSION_COLOUR, and so on.

# Bugzilla versions which we know about, in order.

# Bugzilla schema versions.  A map from Bugzilla version to
# the version which introduces the schema used in that version.

{version_schema_map}
{version_remark}

# This is a map from table name to an HTML remark concerning that
# table, which is output before the schema for that table.
#
# Tables with no attached remarks are given 'None' as a placeholder, so
# we know to add a remark later.

{table_added_remark}

{table_removed_remark}

# This is a map from table name to a map from column name to HTML
# remark for that column.  At present, these remarks include schema
# change comments (which will eventually be generated automatically).
#
# Columns with no attached remarks are given 'None' as a placeholder,
# so we know to add a remark later.

{column_remark}

# This is a map from table name to a map from column name to canonical
# column name.  For use when a column has been renamed but not
# otherwise changed.

{column_renamed}

# This is a map from table name to a map from column name to HTML
# remark for that column.  At present, these remarks include schema
# change comments (which will eventually be generated automatically).

# so we know to add a remark later.

# change comments (which will eventually be generated automatically).

# This is a map from table name to a map from index name to HTML
# remark for that index.  At present, these remarks include schema
# change comments (which will eventually be generated automatically).
#
# Indexes with no attached remarks are given 'None' as a placeholder,
# so we know to add a remark later.
